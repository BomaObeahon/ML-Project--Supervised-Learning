Diabetes Prediction Project

Introduction:
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes based on various factors using machine learning models. The dataset used contains information about individuals' pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

Analysis:

The average glucose level for individuals with diabetes is approximately 142.13, while for individuals without diabetes, it is around 110.68.
The average BMI for individuals with diabetes is approximately 35.38, and for individuals without diabetes, it is around 30.89.
The dataset is imbalanced, with 500 instances of non-diabetic individuals and 268 instances of diabetic individuals.

Model Performance:

Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.
Random Forest performed the best with an accuracy score of 0.76.

Conclusion:

The dataset contains information about various factors related to diabetes.
Random Forest is the preferred model for predicting diabetes onset.
The dataset is imbalanced, which can affect model performance.
Glucose level is found to be the most important feature for predicting diabetes.

Note: Outliers were present in the dataset, and further preprocessing may be required for better model performance.
